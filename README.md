### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm David, and once-upon a time I wrote some code. Nowadays I write manager code (your judgments are likely all valid).

I like to [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5253695-david) and learn about various topics.

For the last ~10 years, I've been managing engineering teams. I've led small and scrappy teams as well as larger teams (~75 ICs, 8 managers). I led teams that built a lot of [Square's public developer platform](https://developer.squareup.com/). I care deeply about enabling people to do their best work.
