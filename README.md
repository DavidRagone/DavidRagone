### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm David, and once-upon a time I wrote some code. Nowadays I write manager code (your judgments are likely all valid).

I like to [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5253695-david) and am on-again-and-off-again active on [the bird app](https://twitter.com/badatreality).

For the last ~5 years, I've been managing teams, and am currently focused on building front-end mobile and web SDKs for [Square's Payment Platform](https://squareup.com/us/en/payments/payment-platform). I care deeply about enabling people to do their best work.
