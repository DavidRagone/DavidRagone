### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm David, and once-upon a time I wrote some code. Nowadays I write manager code (your judgments are likely all valid).

I like to [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5253695-david), occassionally [write](https://davidragone.com/blog/) something, and one day perhaps will do more than just [like and retwweet](https://twitter.com/badatreality). 

For the last ~5 years, I've been managing teams, and am currently focused on building front-end mobile and web SDKs for [Square's Payment Platform](https://squareup.com/us/en/payments/payment-platform). I care deeply about enabling people to do their best work.
